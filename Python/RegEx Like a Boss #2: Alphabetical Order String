Create a Regular Expression that matches a string with lowercase characters in alphabetical order, including any number of spaces. Leading and trailing whitespace is also allowed. An empty string should match.

Your regex should match:

""
"abc"
"aaabc "
"a bc"
"  abcdefghijk"
"abdfkmnpstvxz"
"cxy"
"cdklstxy"
"bfrtw"
"a b c  "
" acg jko pr"
"a z "
"v  z"
"a  b cdefg kl"
"uv xyz"
" ab de gh"
"x yz"
"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
"a bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

It should NOT match:

"abcb"
"a bcdjkrza"
"qwerty"
"zyxcba"
"abcdfe"
"ab c dfe"
"a  z  a"
"asdfg"
"asd  f g"
"poqwoieruytjhfg"

My code:
REGEX = r'^ *a* *b* *c* *d* *e* *f* *g* *h* *i* *j* *k* *l* *m* *n* *o* *p* *q* *r* *s* *t* *u* *v* *w* *x* *y* *z* *$'
